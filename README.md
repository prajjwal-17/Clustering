# K-Means Clustering on Customer Data

This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm to analyze customer segmentation based on annual income and spending score using Python. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to enhance targeted marketing strategies.

## Overview

In this project, we:
- Loaded and preprocessed the customer dataset.
- Scaled the features using `StandardScaler`.
- Employed the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Implemented K-Means clustering to categorize customers.
- Visualized the results to provide insights into customer segmentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Mall_Customers.csv`, which contains information about customers, including their annual income and spending score. Ensure you place the dataset in the correct directory for the script to load it.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You can set up a virtual environment and install the required packages:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the required packages
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kmeans-clustering.git
cd kmeans-clustering
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python kmeans_clustering.py
Make sure to adjust the file path in the script to point to your dataset location.

Results
The script will generate two plots:

Elbow Method Plot: Helps identify the optimal number of clusters based on inertia.
Cluster Visualization: Displays customer clusters along with their centroids.
